## Booking flights with Key Travel (ISU employees)

Detailed instructions for using Key Travel can be found in this [document](./ISU_Key_Travel_instructions.pdf). Steps 1-9 need to be done by you. In step 8, the P-card holder to use is Robin Gogerty (rgogerty@iastate.edu).

## Booking flights with Key Travel (non-ISU employees)

If you are not an ISU employee and do not want to advance the money for your flights, you should contact Robin Gogerty who can use her account to book the flights for you.
