# Onboarding information for new members

## Postdocs

NB this guide is based on the international scholar experience - things may be different for domestic postdocs

### initial steps (to be completed ASAP)

- (foreigners only) register for a check-in session with the ISSO (International Students and Scholars Office) on their website. If you are an ISU employee, this check-in needs to be done before or on your first day. You can also ask them about your eligibility for tax treaties.
- (ISU employees only) then register with payroll and HR, following the instructions given by the ISSO.
- contact Janet at the EEOB so she can register you in the system. Your doctoral diploma is required for this step, please talk to Tracy if you do not have it yet.
- once you are in the system, go to the ISU card office to get an ISU card and register for an Access+ account. 
- with your ISU card, register for a NET-ID, which will give you access to all IT services including an ISU email.
- (foreigners only) once you are in the system, apply for a permanent SSN at the Social Security administration. The new SSN card will be sent directly to the ISU and you will get an email when it arrives.

### later steps

- register for an account on learn@ISU (learn@iastate.edu) and complete the required Title IX training. If your account shows both the Supervisor and Not Supervisor versions, you only need to complete one.
- (foreigners only) you will get an invitation to a new scholar introduction session with the ISSO. This session gives information about your visa and the requirements tied to it.
- (ISU employees only) you will get a form by email for signing up for benefits, to be completed within 30 days. Note that health insurance is mandatory for foreigners.

### optional steps

- (ISU employees only) you can obtain a bus pass at the Cyride office once you have an ISU card. NB: you will need to prove that you are employed/paid by the ISU.
- (foreigners only) signing up for a tax treaty is done at the Administrative Building, Payroll Office. NB: the permanent SSN is required.
